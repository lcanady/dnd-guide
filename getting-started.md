# Getting Started with D&D

## What is D&D?

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game first published in 1974. Players create characters that embark on imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting, guided by a Dungeon Master (DM).

## Basic Requirements

1. **Player's Handbook** - The essential rulebook for players
2. **Dice Set** - A complete set includes d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20
3. **Character Sheet** - To record your character's information
4. **Writing Materials** - Pencils, erasers, and note-taking supplies

## Core Concepts

### The Role of the Dungeon Master
- Narrates the story
- Controls non-player characters (NPCs)
- Adjudicates rules
- Creates and manages the game world

### Basic Game Flow
1. DM describes the environment
2. Players describe their actions
3. DM narrates the results

### Rolling Dice
- Most actions are resolved using a twenty-sided die (d20)
- Add relevant modifiers to the roll
- Compare against a target number or opposing roll
